    [Intro]
    <br/> Look, if you had, one shot or one opportunity
    <br/> To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
    <br/> Would you capture it, or just let it slip?
    <br/> Yo
    <br/>
    <br/> [Verse 1]
    <br/> His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
    <br/> There's vomit on his sweater already: mom's spaghetti
    <br/> He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
    <br/> To drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting
    <br/> What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
    <br/> He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
    <br/> He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
    <br/> The clock's run out, time's up, over - blaow
    <br/> Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity
    <br/> Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
    <br/> Give up that easy nope, he won't have it, he knows
    <br/> His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
    <br/> He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
    <br/> When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
    <br/> Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
    <br/> He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
    <br/>
    <br/> [Hook] x2
    <br/> You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
    <br/> You own it, you better never let it go
    <br/> You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    <br/> This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
    <br/>
    <br/> [Verse 2]
    <br/> The soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
    <br/> This world is mine for the taking, make me king
    <br/> As we move toward a New World Order
    <br/> A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
    <br/> Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
    <br/> Homie grows hotter, he blows it's all over
    <br/> These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
    <br/> He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
    <br/> God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
    <br/> He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
    <br/> But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
    <br/> These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
    <br/> They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
    <br/> He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
    <br/> Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
    <br/> But the beat goes on: da-da-dum da-dum dah-dah
    <br/>
    <br/> [Hook]

    <br/>
    <br/> [Verse 3]
    <br/> No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
    <br/> Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
    <br/> I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
    <br/> I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
    <br/> But I kept rhyming and stepped right in the next cypher
    <br/> Best believe somebody's paying the Pied Piper
    <br/> All the pain inside amplified by the
    <br/> Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-five
    <br/> And I can't provide the right type of
    <br/> Life for my family, cause man, these God damn
    <br/> Food stamps don't buy diapers, and there's no movie
    <br/> There's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
    <br/> And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
    <br/> Tryna feed and water my seed plus, teeter-totter
    <br/> Caught up between being a father and a prima donna
    <br/> Baby momma drama, screaming on her too much for me to wanna
    <br/> Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
    <br/> Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail, I've got
    <br/> To formulate a plot, or end up in jail or shot
    <br/> Success is my only motherfuckin' option - failure's not
    <br/> Mom, I love you but this trailer's got to go
    <br/> I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
    <br/> So here I go it's my shot, feet: fail me not
    <br/> This may be the only opportunity that I got
    <br/>
    <br/> [Hook]

    <br/> [Outro]

    <br/> You can do anything you set your mind to, man
